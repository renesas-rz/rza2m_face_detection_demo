1. Before Use

  This sample code has been run and confirmed by the CPU board (RTK7921053C00000BE) 
  and the SUB board (RTK79210XXB00000BE) with the RZ/A2M group R7S921053VCBG. 
  Use this readme file, the application note, and the sample code as a reference 
  for your software development.


  ****************************** CAUTION ******************************
   This sample code are all reference, and no one to guarantee the 
   operation. Please use this sample code for the technical 
   reference when customers develop software.

2. System Verification

  This sample code was developed and tested with the following components:

    CPU                                 : RZ/A2M
    Board                               : RZ/A2M CPU board (RTK7921053C00000BE)

    Integrated development environment  : e2 studio 2021-04
    Emulator                            : SEGGER J-Link Base
                                          (Customers are required to prepare J-Link emulator compatible with RZ/A2M.)

3. About Sample Code

    In the example, we connect the Sony IMX219 CMOS sensor through MIPI interface, input a 1280x720 resolution image, 
	and use DRP in RZ/A2M to perform Simple ISP processing and image scaling processing on the input image, 
	and then run a light and efficient mask face detection mode

    The application program is executed by the loader program after performing the register setting processing of 
    the SPI multi I/O bus controller (SPIBSC) and the serial flash memory by the loader program.
    The loader program is stored in the following folder.
      ["Project name"\bootloader\rza2_qspi_flash_ddr_bootloader.elf]

    This loader program conforms to the specification of Macronix MX25L51245G. When using another serial flash memory, 
    change the source code of the loader program project [rza2m_sflash_boot_loader_gcc] that is included in 
    "RZ/A2M Group Example of Booting from Serial Flash Memory" application note according to the specifications of 
    the flash memory, and then generate the new load module. The project debug configuration uses the loader program
    after changing the file name of the generated load module to "rza2_qspi_flash_ddr_bootloader.elf".

   Refer to application notes for the details about the sample code. 


4. Operation Confirmation Conditions

  (1) Boot mode
    - Boot mode 3
      (Boot from serial flash memory 3.3V)
      * The program can not be operated if the boot mode except the above is specified.

  (2) Operating frequency
      The RZ/A2M clock pulse oscillator module is set to ensure that the RZ/A2M clocks on the CPU board
      board have the following frequencies:
      (The frequencies indicate the values in the state that the clock with 24MHz
      is input to the EXTAL pin in RZ/A2M clock mode 1.)
      - CPU clock (I clock)                 : 528MHz
      - Image processing clock (G clock)    : 264MHz
      - Internal bus clock (B clock)        : 132MHz
      - Peripheral clock1 (P1 clock)        :  66MHz
      - Peripheral clock0 (P0 clock)        :  33MHz
      - QSPI0_SPCLK                         :  66MHz
      - CKIO                                : 132MHz

  (3) Serial flash memory used
    - Manufacturer  : Macronix Inc.
    - Product No.   : MX25L51245G

  (4) Setting for cache
      Initial setting for the L1 and L2 caches is executed by the MMU. 
      Refer to the "RZ/A2M group Example of Initialization" application note about "Setting for MMU" for 
      the valid/invalid area of L1 and L2 caches.


5. Operational Procedure

  Use the following procedure to execute this sample code.

  (1) Setting for DIP switches and jumpers  
    Set the DIP switches and jumpers of the CPU board as follows.

     <<Setting for CPU board>>
      - SW1-1  : ON  (Disabled SSCG function)
        SW1-2  : OFF (Setting to clock mode 1(EXTAL input clock frequency : 20 to 24MHz))
        SW1-3  : ON  (MD_BOOT2 = L)
        SW1-4  : OFF (MD_BOOT1 = H)
        SW1-5  : OFF (MD_BOOT0 = H)
        SW1-6  : ON  (BSCANP normal mode (CoreSight debug mode))
        SW1-7  : ON  (CLKTEST OFF)
        SW1-8  : ON  (TESTMD OFF)
      - JP3 :   Open (Use USB ch 0 in the function mode (Not supply VBUS0 power))

    Set the DIP switches and jumpers of the SUB board as follows.

     <<Setting for SUB board>>
      - SW6-1  : OFF (Setting to use P9_[7:0], P8_[7:1], P2_2, P2_0, P1_3, P1_[1:0], P0_[6:0], P6_7, P6_5, P7_[1:0] and P7[5:3] 
                      as DRP, audio, UART, CAN and USB interface terminals respectively)
        SW6-2  : OFF (Setting to use P8_4, P8_[7:6], P6_4 and P9_[6:3] as audio interface terminals)
        SW6-3  : OFF (Setting to use P9_[1:0], P1_0 and P7_5 as UART and USB interface terminals respectively)
        SW6-4  : OFF (Setting to use P6_[3:1] and PE_[6:0] as CEU terminals)
        SW6-5  : OFF (Setting to use P3_[5:1], PH_5 and PK_[4:0] as FLCTL terminals)
        SW6-6  : ON  (Setting to use PJ_[7:6] as VDC6 terminals)
        SW6-7  : ON  (Setting to use PA_[7:4] as VDC6 terminals)
        SW6-8  : OFF (NC)
        SW6-9  : OFF (P5_3 = "H")
        SW6-10 : OFF (PC_2 = "H")

      - JP1 : 2-JP2  (Setting to use PJ_1 as interrupt terminal for IRQ0 switch (SW3))

    Refer to the CPU board and the SUB board user's manual for more details about
    setting for the DIP switches and jumpers.

  Refer Quick Start Guide(R01QS0027) for building, downloading, and running this application.
  
  (2) Push SW3 button to switch demo mode: face+mask, face only, mask only
